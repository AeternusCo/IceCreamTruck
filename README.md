# Ice Cream Truck

A drop-in replacement PCB for Minivan cases with choc v1 switches.

**N.B.** At the date of publication, some keys don't exist so they'll either need to use smaller key sizes or 3d printed keys.

PCB has been tested, but order at your own risk.

## Features

- STM32F072 (or F042) MCU
- Drop-in compatibility with existing minivan cases
- Choc v1 switch footprints

## Firmware

ICT runs QMK. Firmware has not been merged into upstream, but should be available in the AeternusCo fork [here](https://github.com/AeternusCo/qmk_firmware).

## Ordering

Generate gerbers, upload to fab house of your choice, pay.
